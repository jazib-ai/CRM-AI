## 🔨 To Build the EXE Installer

Unfortunately, building an `.exe` installer **requires** Node.js (one-time setup). Here are your options:

### Option A: Do It Yourself (Recommended)

**One-time setup (15 minutes):**

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Download: https://nodejs.org/
   - Run installer (click Next, Next, Install)
   - Takes 2-3 minutes

2. **Build the EXE:**
   - Double-click `BUILD.bat` in the project folder
   - Wait 5-10 minutes
   - Your `.exe` will be in the `dist/` folder

3. **Done!**
   - You now have `NexoGenix CRM Setup.exe`
   - You can uninstall Node.js if you want
   - The `.exe` works standalone forever

### Option B: Ask Someone to Build It

**If you can't install Node.js:**

1. Ask a friend/colleague who has Node.js
2. Give them the project folder
3. They run `BUILD.bat`
4. They give you the `.exe` from `dist/` folder
5. You install and use it

### Option C: Use GitHub Actions (Free Cloud Build)

**If you have a GitHub account:**

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all project files
3. The `.github/workflows/build.yml` file is already included
4. Go to "Actions" tab → Run workflow
5. Download the `.exe` from "Releases" section

## ❓ Why Can't I Just Get the EXE?

The `.exe` file is **built** from the source code using special tools (Electron Builder). These tools require Node.js to run. 

Think of it like:
- Source code = Recipe
- Node.js = Kitchen
- BUILD.bat = Chef
- .exe = Finished meal

You need the kitchen (Node.js) to cook the meal (.exe), but once it's cooked, you can throw away the kitchen and just eat the meal!
